I own none of these files, credit for everything goes to their rightful owner(s).
btw, these are all just files from https://archive.org/details/psp-portal 
hosted on a github io website instead of putting them on my PSP's memory card.
feel free to use this for your PSP as well!

Things to do:
1) Upload all 8 web portals.
Progress on 1: 6/8

2) Make an actual site
instead of this hodge podge of stolen html files.
Progress on 2: 0%

4) Test it on actual PSP hardware
Progress on 3: 0%
PSP 1000: Not yet, don't have one.
PSP 2000: Not yet, don't have one either.
PSP 3000: Not yet, I'm gonna wait until all of web portals are up.
PS Vita: Same excuse as above
PSP eCFW via Adrenaline: Same excuse as above
PSP eCFW via ARK4 Vita: Same excuse as above
PPSSPP: IDK if that'll even work. maybe with a homebrew web browser?

Long term goals:
Progress on 1: 0%
1) Eventually make a LLE PSP emulator to test this and other XMB nonsense or if someone else gets
around to it first (this one is more probable) then use theirs and test it on there.
